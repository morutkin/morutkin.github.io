## Background 
 At the 25th Conference of the Parties, in addition to the negotiations and press conferences that were going on, they also had booths where organizations would present research and informaive materials to anyone who stops by their booth. When I was at COP 25, I spent a lot of time exploring the many organizations represented at this section of the conference. One of the booths present was from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) which presented a VR experience that uses immersive storytelling to focus attention on the climate importance and opportunity of reducing oil, gas, and methane emissions. Players, such as myself who had the chance to participate in this virtual experience got to be climate heroes stopping multiple gas leaks at a real wellsite once transported behind the no-trespass fence line.
 
## The Experience
During this experience, I thought it was super interesting to be the contributing player that was able to take control of the situation. As soon as the experience started, I was sucked into a dry murky world where my hands and feet belonged to a different person. Within this world, I was faced with a complicated situation of a WICKED problem where I had a pretty uncontrollable issue at hand with multiple gas leaks happening within my proximity with little man power. Due to the situation that the simulation presented, it was impossible to hope that you can get the most optimal outcome of not destroying the environment, but it was at the fact that I can at least try to reduce some of the disastrous effects that kept me going. During the entire time, I could feel my heartbeat escalating as I got more and more immersed into the situation. At that point, I saw that the EDF had succeeded in developing empathy for the situation within me and with that, it allowed me to see the importance of climate change through a different lense. Seeing these disasters happen before my eyes allowed me to personalize the urgency of the situation. This Methane Challenge which allowed me to find and fix the digitally simulated well site shows the ease and efficiency of controlling key sources of methane emissions, an increasingly important challenge for the oil and gas industry. My hope is that key leaders in this industry can also take part in this simulation so that they can use the knowledge that they gained to improve their busiess products to be more environmentally friendly.

## Reasoning 
One of the reasons why the EDF focused on this particular simulation was because EDFâ€™s goal to zero in on the opportunities that offer the biggest benefit to the environment soonest and reducing methane emissions across the global oil and gas supply chain is one such opportunity.
 

## Conclusion
Overall, this was a nice experience to bring the urgency of the situation to light to more people who don't see the consequences of their actions in their daily life. I hope that more people at COP 25 who do not come from oil industry backgrounds had the opportunity to experience this virtual reality as well.
