## Background 
 At COP 25, one of the side exhibits that were present was from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) which presented a VR experience that uses immersive storytelling to focus attention on the climate importance and opportunity of reducing oil gas methane emissions. Players, such as myself who had the chance to join this virtual experience got to be climate heroes stopping multiple gas leaks at a real wellsite once transported behind the no-trespass fence line.
 
## The Experience
During this experience, I thought it was super interesting to be the contributing player that was able to take control of the situation. As soon as the experience started, I was sucked into a dry murky world where my hands and feet belonged to a different universe. Within this world, I was faced with a complicated situation of a WICKED problem where I had a pretty uncontrollable issue at hand with multiple gas leaks happening within my proximity with little man power. It was not a point of getting the most optimal result of not destroying the environment, but it was at the fact that I can at least try to reduce some of the disastrous effects that kept me going. During the entire time, I could feel my heartbeat escalating as i got more and more immersed into the situation. At that point I saw that the EDF has succeeded in their mission in allowing me to see the importance of climate change. Seeing these disasters happen before my eyes allowed me to personalize the urgency of the situation. This "Methane CHallenge" which allowed us to "find and fix"the digitally simulated well site  shows the ease and efficiency of controlling key sources of methane emissions, an increasingly important challenge for the oil and gas industry.

## Reasoning 
One of the reasons why the EDF focused on this particular simulation was because EDFâ€™s goal to zero in on the opportunities that offer the biggest benefit to the environment soonest and reducing methane emissions across the global oil and gas supply chain is one such opportunity.
 

## Conclusion
Overall, this was a nice experience to bring the urgency of the situation to light to more people who don't see the consequences in their daily life. I hope that more people at COP 25 who do not come from these backgrounds had the opportunity to experience this virtual reality as well. Watch this [Video][vv] to see the how the VR simulation looked like.
