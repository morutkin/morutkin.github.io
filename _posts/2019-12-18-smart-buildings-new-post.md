<br> Over the last decade, as airplane tickets became cheaper and more accessible to a greater mass of people, we see a an incline of pollution being emitted by the aviation industry. The calculated mass of Jet fuel is about 259 mill tonnes and they contribute more than 700 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year 
Because CO2 from international aviation is not emitted within the borders of one country, its emissions are not part of negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [International Transport Forum, Aviation][ITF]


<br> Over and above carbon-neutral growth from 2020, the International Transport Forum aims to bring aviation’s CO2 emissions down to half of their 2005 level by 2050 [ITF] Passenger transport will increase nearly three‐fold between 2015 and 2050, from 44 trillion to 122 trillion passenger‐kilometres. And China and India will generate a third of passenger travel by 2050, compared with a quarter in 2015.
Aviation passenger‐kilometres in India and China alone are expected to increase almost four‐fold by 2050, to 21 583 billion from an estimated 5 506 billion in 2015. [J. Larsson, Climate Policy Journal][jj]

<br> With the growth in the amount of people flying, it is no suprise that the emissions from aviation are growing 3-5% annually. Aviation emissions represent 2.1% of global emissions, when non-CO2 effects are included, aviation contributes 4.9% to global warming problem (other GHG emissions and water vapor). 
The Aviation sector is a top-ten global emitter, accounting for 12% of all emissions from transportation. [J. Green, Washington Post][gg]

At the 1992 UNFCCC, international air travel was exempted from climate regulation, and Air travel is also taxed less as well. However, looking at the fact that 
A round trip ticket from New York to Madrid costs about 3 square miles of Arctic ice, and with Air travel is predicted to double within 20 years, we need to enforce more policy regulations around carbon emissions to reduce pollution from this particular sector. With this background, we aim to focus our project on the research and policy that can bring Aviation towards more sustainable practices. [International Transport Forum, Aviation][ITF]
