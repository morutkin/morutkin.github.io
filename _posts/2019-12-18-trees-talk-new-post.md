During this specific TEDx talk, Dr. Suzanne Simard, a forest ecologist at the University of British Columbia, talks about the complex, symbiotic networks within our forests.

She start off by talking about how trees have biological pathways that allows them to communicate with one another due to their mutualistic relationship with underground fungi that attaches to their roots. These fungi spread underground to like with hundreds and thousands of other trees creating a network underground that allows for information to be passed down between trees. The fungi involved is white mysyllium, and this fungi, along with the roots are the basis of the forest.

She went to prove that trees can share information below ground by checking to see if a tree sent photosynthesiszed carbon (sugar) from one tree to another. Dr. Simard was able to check if the carbon passed by using radioactive carbon 14 for her experiement so that she can track the passage of that particilar carbon easily. Her results ended up being successful which shows that her trees are using the below ground channels to communicate with one another! Later research shows that sometimes a tree may be getting more sugars and minerals from other trees than it is giving off themselves, and vise versa depending on the seasons and the conditions. This is because this interwoven network contains a diverse set of trees that all have different strengths depending on certain conditions. For example, the Birch produces more sugars in the summer so it's able to send more sugars to the Furs that are not generating as mch sugar in that season, and vise versa. We see a nondiscriminating act of kindness and helfullness coming from each of these trees within the network. There is an interdependences between the trees in the networks connected by the fungi show them as cooperators.

One of the things I found very fascinating about this particular TED talk was that the network that was created underground greatly resemble neural netowrks, which in out brains, and in computer science is used to send signals to different neurons and can help to eforce learning mechanisms. Dr. Simard also emphasizies the presence of learning within trees by tlking about how old trees pass down information to the youger trees about certain red flags to look for, and is basically passing down the lessons that it has learn or heard from other trees to improve the next younger generation of trees. I was dumbfounded with the strong communty that trees have with each other and never would I have thought that the trees actually talk to each other. I think that this discovery goes to show the importance of community involvement in adpatation and mitigation efforts through the gradual learning and sharing of information between each other.
