Greta Thunberg, the face of the climage change movement and a strong advocate for the #TimeForAction movement talks about her introduction to the world of climate change and why she has a passion for fighting against further change due to anthropogenic factors. 

She talks on how her Aspbergers has helped her not falling into the societal game of stying business as usual while the earth is slowly depreciating with the effects of fossil fuels. It boggled her mind how ther has been no action to ban fossil fuels and how its not making the headlines. She talks about the lack of presence of the climate change crisis within our political realm, it is not priopritized and barely talked about besides the fact that not adressing this issue can lead to the slow destruction of civilization. The extinction rates are 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than what is seen as normal.

She talks about how a lot of people do not know the vast consequences of their everyday life. They are not aware of the externalities of what their everyday routine do to impact other people and ecosystems ailke. You would think that with all the natural disasters killing thousands of people that there wold be laws to help prevent that from happening agian, or at least more press coverage on the topic, but sadly, it still does little to bring the topic of cliamte change to the forfront of negotiations. 


She brings the scope of the conversation to the sacaling of her lifeline. How in the year 3075, she would be a senior and how she wouldn't know what to tell her grandchildren about the previous generation if asked about why they didn't do anyting to stop the climate crisis. Greta then emphasizes the point again that it is time to act now. People were saying how she should be a climate scientist but she brought up the fact that there are already solutions, we re just not willing to  change to actually enable them. and how she doesn't understadn studyinf for a future that she may not even have. 

She concludes her talk by talking about how the one thing that we need more than hope is action, and once we have action, hope is everywhere. We can't play by the rules to stop the crisis cause the rules have to change. A lot of people don'tthink that they can make a significant impact in the fight for climate change. They belive that it is all in the hands of the polititians, companies, and scientistis. But Greta goes to show that this is not true. If a student from Sweden can make such a major impact in the fight for cliamte change. Imagine what we can do if we draw on our skills and fight together for OUR future.
