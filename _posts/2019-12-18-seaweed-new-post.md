Time Flannary, an evnironmentalist, talks about the potential of aglae, as a tool for planetary-scale interventions to combat climate change.

Algae, is a carbon sink in that it grows at a rapid place due to the abundance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If we can keep the Co2 in the seaweed locked up long term, it can significantly contribite to solving the cliamte problem. 

![Seaweed][https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/environment/2019/08/seaweed-farming/seaweed-farming.jpg]

He talks about a lot of people talking aobut the solution to the crisis is carbon offsets, but it doesn't really work due to the fact that carbon ofsetting is just about putting in CO2 as much as we're drawing out, however, if we need to draw out a lot more than wee putting in, then this model doesn't really work. One out-of-thebox idea to adress both of these is by using algae to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere by excessive amounts and mantain it as a form of carbon capture. Apperently if we use 9% of the ocean's surface to cover in seaweed, we could potentially draw down equivilent of all of the green house gasses that we put up in one year  ( + 50 gtC), its about 4 1/2 Austrailias. Seaweed farms can be the future in reducing these carbon emissions but there are cureently no seaweed farms taking place. Seaweed can grow a meter a day, and with the right infrastructure, can take carbon out of its natural cycle for hundreds of years. Once it is caputed, that carbon is out of the cycle for a millenia. Although it has huge potential, there is a lot that could go wrong.

Some of the possible things to look out for is that fact that seaweed can have unpredictable effects on the biodiversity within the oceans. He counters that by putting the seaweed in there, we can enhance a natural process. But in general we would not know the effects until we try. It's a 6 billion dollar per year busiesses, it can also help product marine protien since the seaweeed would make it less acidic. In addtion, it provides a lot of protine to people and ocean permaculture can offer a solution.

We have to go from a carbon emitting economy to a carbon absorbing one, and seaweed may provide a major pathway into that.
