## Background

Because Mountains are the home of more than 15% of the world's population, in addition to a quarter of the world’s land animals and plants, the UN has dedicated Wednesday December 11th to Mountain day. This day is when we acknowledge that the mountains are under threat of climate change and that we must reduce our carbon footprint and take care of these natural treasures. The theme for 2019’s mountain day is of the hardships on the youth who deal with the climate change effects on mountains terrains. In honor of mountain day, I went to a side event at the COP 25 dedicated to talking about the use of data and science to help these youth communities build resilience within their mountain homes. Our panelists for this talk includes Ms. Rosalaura Romeo with Andorra, Mr. Eric Chavez with Asociación Civil Oikos (OIKOS), Ms. Antonella Sorrentino from Georgia, and Mr. Giorgio Grussu from Jamaica.

## Data Usage 

This particular conference first looked at Jamaica's mountain ecosystems with Mr. Giorgio Grussu. They talked about the National Forest Management & Conservation plan (2016)  which drives Jamaica's position in ensuring the conservation of their mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development. In order to spurr climate action for mountain conservation, there would need to be cooperation between the Research Institutions, Society, Corporations, and the Public Administrations. I thought that this point in particular is very true for many other resilience programs for other sustainable development goals as well. Solving a problem at as large a scale as this one would need a very interdisciplinary approach with all involved parties participating in achieving mitigation and conservation goals.

 In order to support this project, this mountain community and many others started collecting data about the people who live there, and the geographic patterns of the land to learn more about these areas. The purpose of the data collection is to help the community make more informed decisions about what is happening in their terrain and how to apporach the problem. One of the conclusions of this data collecting project was that 1 in 2 rural mountain people face vulnerabilities to food insecurity with a 12% increase in the food insecure people between 2012 and 2017. In 2017, more than 85 million rural mountain people lived in extremely remote areas with no access to basic town facilities. And between 2000 and 2018, approximately 40% of the worlds conflict occur in mountains. Knowing this, non-profits have been putting considerable effort into providing a source of food and safety for these mountain people. In addition to the information about the people, the data collected has also helped some communities target areas that are more likely to get logged. From this information, they are able to stop the logging from happening by getting to these areas first, or to get there early enough to prevent severe damage. 
 
## Conclusion 

 Knowing this data, one of the main takeaways that a lot of the speakers had for us was that we seriously need a call for action within these mountainous areas, specifically we need to 1) make targeted investments in the youth 2) focus on sustainable production and diversification of food ecosystems 3) strengthen skills and value chains and 4) create more mountain specific sustainability policies.
