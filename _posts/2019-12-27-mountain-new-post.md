## Background 
Because Mountains are the home of the 15% of the world's population and a quarter of the world’s land animals and plants, we dedicate Wednesday December 11th to Mountain day. This day is when we acknowledge that the mountains are under threat of climate change and we must reduce our carbon footprint and take care of these natural treasures. The theme for 2019’s mountain day is the hardships on the youth who deal with the climate change effects on mountains. Thus this side event held on mountain day talks about the use of data and science to help these youth communities build resilience within their mountain homes. Our panelists for this talk is Ms. rosalaura romeo with Andorra, Mr. Eric Chavez with Asociación Civil Oikos (OIKOS), Ms. antonella sorrentino from Georgia, and Mr. giorgio grussu from Jamaica.

## Data Usage 

This particular conference first looked at Jamaica's mountain ecosystems with Mr. Giorgio Grussu. They talked about the National Forest Management & Conservation plan (2016)  which drives Jamaica's position in ensuring the conservation of their mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development. In order to spurr climate action for the mountains, there would need to be cooperation within the Research Institutions, Society, Corporations, and the Public Administrations. I thought that this point in particular is very true for many other resilience programs for other sustainable development goals as well.

 In order to support this project, this mountain community and many others started collecting data about the people who live there, and the geographical patterns of the land to learn more about these areas. One of the conclusions  of this project was that 1 in 2 rural mountain people face vulnerabilities to food insecurity. There has been a 12% increase in the food insecure people between 2012 and 2017. In 2017, more than 85 million rural mountain people lived in extremely remote areas with no access to basic town facilities. And between 2000 and 2018, approximately 40% of the worlds conflict occur in mountains. 
 
## Conclusion 

 Knowing this data, one of the main takeaways that a lot of the speakers had for us was that we need a call for action within these areas, specifically we need to 1) make targeted investments in the youth 2) focus on sustainable production and diversification of food ecosystems 3) strengthen skills and value chains and 4) create mor mountain specific policies.
