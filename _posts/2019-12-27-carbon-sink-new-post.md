At the 25th Conference of the Parties, in addition to the negotiations and press conferences that were going on, they also had booths where organizations would present research and informaive materials to anyone who stops by their booth. When I was at COP 25, I spent a lot of time exploring the many organizations represented at this section of the conference. Out of the many booths that I visited, one of the booths that I encountered there was by European Business Council for Sustainable Energy (e5), International Council for Sustainable Energy (ICSE), Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII), and CUTS International where they look at how technology will demonstrate zero carbon & carbon-negative solutions for building material to reach the 1.5Â°C target. Specifically, they looked at Technocarbon's trial on trying to use Algae oils to create carbon fibers that can be used to intwine granite pieces to create sturdy building material.

A volunteer at this particular booth was pointing out how there has been a recent abundance of Granite and although it serves as a very thick material, it lacks the elasticity and sturdiness when cut down into thin slices. This makes this rock a little less appealing to people who would need more stable materials to build infrastructure. Therefore, the organizations metioned above has been working with Technocarbon to create an extremely tension-stable carbon fiber that consists of nearly 100% pure carbon and entwine it into the granite. These 100% carbon materials were created from algae which are natural carbon sinks for the environment. The carbon-fibre/stone bond is adjusted by hardening the algae oil composition, resulting in a composite material with a combination of completely new and formerly unknown properties. This constitutes a technologically sound way to replace (at least to some extent) metals, that are Co2 emission intensive. In addition to this, it takes 20% less energy to create materials this way than with the metal alternative.

Overall, I enjoyed having the opportunity to learn about new and creative ideas on how they can use more abundant resources around us to store the carbon and use it for something that can help create more resilient infrastructure for communities.
