When I was at COP 25, I spent a lot of time exploring a lot of the country pavilions and booths that were at the conference as well. One of the booths that I encountered there was by European Business Council for Sustainable Energy (e5), International Council for Sustainable Energy (ICSE),Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII), and CUTS International where they look at how tehcnology will demonstrate zero carbon & carbon-negative solutions for building material to reach the 1.5Â°C target. Specifically, they looked at Technocarbon's trial on trying to use Algae oils to create carbon fibers that cab be used to intwine granite peices to create sturdy building material.

A volunteer at the booth was pointing out how there has been a recent abundance of Granite that is very sturdy as a thik material, but it cannot be as elastic and sturdy when cut down into thin slices. This makes this rock a little less appealing to people who would need more stable rocks to build infrastructure. Therefore, the organizations metioned above has been working with Technocarbon to extremely tension-stable carbon fibre that consists of nearly 100% pure carbon and entwine it into the granite. These 100% carbon materials were created from algae which are natural carbon sinks for the environment. The carbon-fibre/stone bond is adjusted by hardening the algae oil composition, resulting in a composite material with a combination of completely new and formerly unknown properties. This constitutes a technologically sound way to replace (at least to some extent) metals, that are Co2 emission intensive. In addition to this, it takes 20% less energy to create materials this way than with the natural concrete alternative.

Overall, I enjoyed having the opportunity to learn about new and creative ideas on how they can use more abundant resources around us to store the carbon and use it for something that can help create more resilient infrastructure for communities.
