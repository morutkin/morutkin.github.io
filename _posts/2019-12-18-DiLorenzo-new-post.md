<br> Before diving into the seminar series, I thought I would spend some time diving into one of his past papers. In Di Lorenzo’s paper on, <i>A double-integration hypothesis to explain ocean ecosystem response to climate forcing</i>, he talks  about how the long term effects seen on Marine ecosystems are usually caused by large amplitude state transitions. These transitions and effects were recorded by the zooplankton’s response to atmospheric forcing. Together, the knowledge of the correlation between the climate forcing with the marine organisms help to link
the profound effects of anthropogenic agents that are changing the states within the marine ecosystem. In his lecture, we see an elaboration on this specific topic.

<br> Di Lorenzo first started off talking about the explanation of climate extremes. Climate extremes are phenomena such as hurricanes that happen pretty frequently on the Pacific coast. And he was saying how these extremes are usually caused by either a change in variability in the intensity or from the change in the mean of the intensity. A lot of these climate extremes being amplified by the change in the mean or the variance is greatly seen in the Pacific coast.
For example, the strongest oceanic heat wave happened on the Paciic coast during the years of 2014 and 2015. This heat blob was the size of the US in the Pacific west coast and had profound effects on marine life, in addition to human life. Some of these impacts include the decrease in the number of salmon, the increase in toxic algae (the dead zone) and a huge die off of mammals and birds within these areas as well. Lastly, we also see a shift in species distribution during these transitioning heat amplitudes within the ocean. 

<br> One of the things I found very interesting about his lecture was how he really tied in the connection of the ocean warming with the drought, in addition to other climate extremes that we have seen recently. A lot of this is due to propagating waves that span into the land that increases the amplitude of the weather extremes. We then looked at a case study in california where the drought in the land and the heat blob in the ocean may look independent of one another, but, when we look closely at the amplitudes, we see that there is actually a 1 year lag in the correlation, and this correlation gets stronger through time. Although the correlation didn’t seem strong then, it has definitely been a lot more strong in the last 20 years. Climate extremes being able to have this effect can also be related to the trade winds from the tropics. Trade winds tend to slow down with the anomaly. When the warmness goes to the equator, it activates el nino and then the trade winds can't get to the equator to blow the evaporation away so it keeps getting warmer. This El Nino southern oscillation links the heatwave blob to the desert heat wave. 

<br> Although this wasn’t quite part of his lecture, Emanuele Di Lorenzo that comes from a strong physics and computer science background and currently is very involved with PISCES, which is a group dedicated to climate change solution and engineering. His background interested me a lot due to the fact that I also which to do something in the future that combines both my Environmental Science background and my CS background.
