COP 25 held in Madrid, Spain in 2019 was said to be a turning point for many countries to start taking action before their commitment to work towards keeping Global temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. COP 25 will be aimed at readying countries to implement the Paris Agreement, and to discuss Article 6, which is essentially a tool for international cooperation. Alex Hanafi, director of multilateral climate strategy at Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) elaborated "It's basically about how countries can cooperate with each other to meet the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement." It would have also created a mechanism by which to establish carbon markets and providing a monetary incentive for nations to step up their carbon-reduction ambition. [Carbon Brief][ccc]

Despite the desparation of the interested parties in making big moves in progressing the movement forward, we say that the delagates agreed to disagree on everything, including Article 6. Not surprisingly, there were a lot of Fossil fuel companies lobbied G20 nations in the run-up to COP25 to make sure their interests led the talks. Nations such as Brazil with abundant rainforests for sale, Australia with abundant coal to burn,  and Saudi Arabia with abundant oil to burn as well made clear that any climate change-mitigation goals would not pass. Ultimately, article 6 remained incomplete, pushing it to next year under “Rule 16” of the UN climate process. Therefore, matters including Article 6, reporting requirements for transparency and “common timeframes” for climate pledges were all delayed until 2020, when countries are also supposed to raise the ambition of their efforts. After the longest COP in history, the secretary general of UN Antonio Guterres reported being "dissapointed", as I'm sure many of us are. [Business Green][bbb]

The need for ambition and the wake up call for #ClimateAction was not heard by many of the negotiators during this conference, however as tensions rise within our society, we hope it will substancially progress ambitious goals in the future.
