For one of the side events at COP25, Mr. Daniele Pagani from the Nordic Folkecenter for Renewable Energy (NFVE), Mr. Kenneth Amoateng from the Abibimman Foundation (AF), and Ms. Hyeji Shin Climate Change Center (CCC) talked about how three continents use the combination of education, local ownership, renewable energy and sustainable business to achieve, both for developing countries and for the industrialized world, a more sustainable community.The speakers all come from different backgrounds from field of sustainable energy, community development, education and business. The three continents that they focus on is Asia, Africa and Europe. 

The first representative, Mr Daniel Pagani talk about how their Folkecenter for renewable energy is a hub for people from all around the world to come and learn about renewables. It's a free program open to anyone, and they had a lot of people who came to the program to get educated on these technologies so that they can bring it back to the communities that they came from. There have been successful stories of people from places such as Nigeria, and Thailand, amongst other developed and developing nations that have made significant impacts on the energy sector of their communities with what they learned here. 

Then, we hear from Kenneth Amoateng who then bring the focus to the education and energy transformation to using bricks for making more energy efficient fuel sources for the community that he comes from in Ghana. They are working on programs to empower the youth in creating more grassroots initiatives around turning to clay bricks for jobs and energy usage. He came up with the Cleancookingmarket.com which strives to make solar energy and other alternative sustainable energies available to the mass public through this website. It is where they are using it to spread awareness of ways in order to make cleaner better stoves. They have also aided in getting women to work in a smokeless environment and to reduce the waste of biofuels and deposing it in a good way.

Lastly, we had a speaker who focused on the phone company SK, focusing on Myanmar and investing billions of dollars to help them pay for more energy efficient cookstoves. 

Due to the fact that these continents are completely different with different sources of fuel at first, it was interesting to see the diversity of approaches that these people had.
