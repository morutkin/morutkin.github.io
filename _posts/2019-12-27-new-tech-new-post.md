## Background 

This strategy is to define how the United Nations system will support the use of new technologies like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, blockchain, and robotics to meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. This sustainable development agenda was set up as a call to action to “end poverty, protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere”. [Sustainable Development UN] [un]

A lot of these new technologies can be used to aid in the  areas of privacy and human rights, equality, ethics, equity, responsibility, transparency, and accountability. The five principles for guidance that the UN plans to use when bringing the use of these technologies forward is: 1) Protect and promote global values of the global UN charter and human rights, 2) Foster inclusion and transparency to allow for the nations to make collective choices about new technologies. 3) Work in partnership to increase collective knowledge, test ideas, and expand dialogue 4) Build on existing capabilities and mandates 5) Be humble and continue to learn.

## Negotiations Within COP25 1

During the 25th session of the Conference of the parties in Madrid, Spain, alothough thse plans for new technologies didn’t take front and center, there were many side events and talks about the use of AI, and blockchain for climate change mitigation and adaptation. For example, the world bank cities talked about the use of AI in making housing more resilient and to prepare infrastructure to be well prepared before the next disaster hits. Another example of interesting applications of AI talked about at the COP was a software from Simens that uses artificial intelligence to calculate the pollution for many days in advance and determines the effectiveness of possible counter-measures. They’re currently conductig tests in Nuremberg,Germany, and the results are looking good so far. [Simens AI][sim]

If we want to look at new policies that was passed during COP that incorporates these new technologies, the International Chamber of Commerce signed a partnership with AirCarbon and Perlin to facilitate carbon credit schemes to reduce worldwide aviation emission. This would help facilitate global adoption of the AirCarbon Exchange which is the world’s first blockchain based distribution and trading network for CORSIA compliant carbon credits. CORSIA compliant carbon credits are the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, that was signed in Montreal in 2016 by 191 countries. After the agreement at COP25, this plan is set to start in 2021 with 80 countries representing more than 77% of international air traffic \ agreeing to commit to more fuel-efficient aircraft, new direct flight paths, and the use of biofuels.
