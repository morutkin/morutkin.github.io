<br>Dr. Seavy broke down her lecture into two different topics. The first one talked about her research on seabirds that reside in the Gulf of Maine, while the other part of her talk covered her open laboratory on Shols that is specifically made for undergraduate research.

<br>Speaking on the first part of the lecture, she started off by talking about seabirds in general. One of the more interesting facts that she told us about that I didn’t really think about before was the fact that seabirds have always had a connection with people, and they were always viewed upon as a positive thing. Seabirds being viewed as a positive symbol came to be by the fact that whenever you would see a seabird it probably meant that a) you’re close to land or b) you were near a spot with plentiful fish. For fishermen who were lost at sea, or was looking to catch lots of fish, finding seabirds nearby was always a good omen. In addition, although 2/3rds of our earth’s surface is covered by ocean, only 3% of the birds are land birds. This is probably due to the fact that you would need to have very specific traits in order to survive the harshness of the ocean. For example, they get all of there food from the ocean so they would have to be in colder water environments where there would be plentiful fish, hence why there is more seabird diversity in the north. Their rarity within the population of birds also makes them more prone to becoming endangered. Some other interesting facts about sea birds are the fact that they have delayed maturation(low reproductive output), they have salt glands to process salt water, and they have a lot denser feathers so it helps them stay afloat.

<br>She then went on to talk about some of the attributes of seabirds that help in the research that they conduct about them. I found it really interesting how, because seabirds are 95% colonial, most of their research are conducted on these colonies. Using the data from the colonies, they say that there is a 70% decline in seabird population, which is very critical because they are so important to knowing marine life heath. I have no idea before her lecture that seabirds placed such an essential role in surveying the marine ecosystem’s health. She noted that some of the biggest impacts on the seabird population that has caused this decline in the population is invasive species, hunting + trapping seabirds for clothes, logging wood, and ocean plastic. Because the Gulf of Maine is heating up 97% faster than other bodies of water around the world, the effects are even more drastic. That is why her research in the Shoals of Maine is being used as a primary spot to conduct research on these organisms.

<br> Overall, it was really interesting to hear Dr. Seavy talk about the importance of seabirds and why they are essential to other marine research being conducted all around the world.
