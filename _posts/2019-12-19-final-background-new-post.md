Aviation emissions policy has often been neglected from negotiations dating back to the UNFCCC in 1992. With the lowering of taxes on flights and the low cost of flight tickets, the aviation industry is said to double in the next 20 years. Keeping the growth of this industry in mind, aviation emission, which makes up for 2.1% of our total emissions can grow immensely in the coming years. Studies show that with poor regualation of this industry, their emissions are expected to triple or quadruple by 2040. In order to support this growth without increasing emissions, regulations will have to be put in place to hold coorporations accountable for its contribution to air pollution. The 2015 Paris agreement, the UNFCCC adopted an instrument to start driving carbon pollution down with a goal of limiting warming to 1.5-2° C, however international aviation pollution was neglected in the conversation. 

### So knowing that aviation pollution have the potential to grow so much, why didn't the Paris agreement cover pollution from flights between countries?

Well, a lot of this has to do with  the fact that in 1997, aviation lobbied for, and got, the UNFCCC to defer these to another UN body, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). ICAO talked about the issue for fifteen years until 2013, when, with Europe poised to enforce a cap on emissions of inbound/outbound flights, ICAO pledged to act by 2016 through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). In addtion, the EU ETS was created as a cap and trade system for aviation comapnies to exchange a limited number of emissions. However, these policies is much less than what is needed to achieve the 2°C target.

This is why, the discussion of article 6 during this years Conference of the Parties, COP 25 is a huge turning point in making more strict cap and trade programs for aviation. Although article, which ------ has been delayed, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Perlin, and AirCarbon have formed a partnership to facilitate carbon credit schemes to reduce worldwide aviation emissions, which is a step in the right direction. They want to facilitate global adoption of the AirCarbon Exchange which is the world’s first blockchain based distribution and trading network for CORSIA compliant carbon credits. This new making is said to imact 77% of the international aviation industry. [International Chamber of Commerce][ITF]

Without any new rules, international aviation’s carbon pollution is expected to skyrocket (top red line). Having a more efficient air traffic control can reduce some pollution (top red wedge). However, if we have a more ambitious CO2 standard, it would mean fewer emissions per passenger-mile, further slowing the sector’s emissions growth (blue wedge). But because the industry’s overall emissions are expected to far outstrip these per-trip efficiency gains, there’s still a huge gap (green triangle) – at least 6-8 billion tonnes – to get to the goal of an emissions cap at 2020 levels (red horizontal line), or even more ambitious goals along the lines of the Paris agreement (red dashed line).

Some mitigation strategies can also include: (1) technological improvements (2) use of low carbon fuels (including biofuels)
 (3) optimized air traffic management for minimizing aviation's CO2 and non-CO2-effects, and (4) reduced air travel volumes compared to business-as-usual.[M. Darby, Climate Home News][iii]

We hope to see these other mitigation strategies come into play with future talk on reducing the emissions from international aviation and upholidng the stakeholders in this industry, more accountable for it.
