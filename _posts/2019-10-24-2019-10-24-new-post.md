## What do technology companies have to do with Carbon Emissions? 
<br> As technology rapidly expands to touch every part of our lives, so does their significant contribution to increase our society's carbon footprint. The impacts of our interactions with technology contribute to our own carbon emissions in more ways than we realized. One of the largest global technology companies that bridges the internet with our carbon footprint is Google. For my blog today, I’ll be focusing on how Google’s products contribute to global carbon emissions and how they mitigate those footprints to reach the [carbon neutral state][wmbc] that they’re at currently.

<br> Google, or their parent company, Alphabet, is a multibillion dollar company, that is most widely known for their search engine and video streaming via Youtube. Although these free services have added a lot of convenience to our daily lives, this convenience comes at a cost. For every Google search we perform, it has a [carbon footprint of 0.2g of CO2 emissions per google search][telegraph] due to the energy put into the servers, cables, and routers that make it work.  And knowing how many google searches we perform in a day, the act of Googling can accumulate a lot of carbon emissions over time. If we look at the fact that Google has, on average, 5 billion search requests per day, this can amount to a conversion of one billion grams of CO2 emissions per day. Our contributions to carbon emissions via the internet spans Youtube as well. For every 10 minutes of youtube that we stream, we emit 1g of CO2 into the atmosphere. Resulting to an annual emissions of [10 million tons of CO2 emissions annually][wired]. However, aside from these major Google products, Google’s main operational agents that make these products work: the Data Centers, make up a large majority of Google’s carbon footprint as well. According to [Nature][nature], data centers use 200 terawatts of energy a year. [Yale][yale] estimates that data center energy consumption put out as much Co2 as the airline industry.

 <br> So with all of these emissions that Google puts off, how are they keeping carbon neutral and what types of mitigation efforts are they putting in place?

<br>Google’s mitigation efforts can be categorized into three different actions according to their [Environmental Report][envrep]: improving energy efficiency, matching their non renewable energy usage with the purchase of renewable energy, and to fund non profit sustainability initiatives such as methane capture projects. 

<br>Google’s largest carbon mitigation efforts definitely go into improving energy efficiency, especially within their 14 data centers across the globe. This has been done through:
1. Using machine learning to reduce the energy usage of the cooling systems by 30%
2. Refurbish old data servers to build new ones. 19% of the data servers are refurbished parts currently 
3. Creating affordable smart home devices (Google Nest) that have amounted to helped customers save nearly 12 billion kWh of energy in 2018—more energy than Google used that same year.

<br> There [initiatives to buy renewable energy][ren] to offset their energy use is a prevalent method as well. Some of these include:
1. Buying 3 gigawatts of wind and solar last year to offset the energy use of its data centers - allowing their energy to match 100% with renewables 
2. Purchasing enough renewable energy to account for their operational costs, amounting to nearly 11 million tCO2 emissions. This is equivalent to taking nearly 2.3 million cars off the road for a year.

The combinations of these renewable energy buying, their energy efficiency efforts, and their carbon offset programs have resulted in  their carbon intensity per unit of revenue decreased by 86% since 2011. Although revenue increased to 136.8 billion dollars, we see a very dramatic reduction in carbon intensity per unit of revenue to 5.5 tCo2 emissions per billion US dollars.

In addition to their overall emissions, if we account for their renewable energy match:

<br>Although Google has been doing a tremendous amount for the sustainability movement, there are some issues that they would need to tackle to further support climate change action

<br>They “matched” 100% of their energy consumption with renewables but its not being used to power Google. One policy recommendation is to focus on the transition of energy sources of their company to more renewables instead of carbon offsetting with the purchase of renewables. This can help bring Google towards a true net zero emissions that isn’t created via matching their emissions with renewable purchases 

<br>Another pressing issue that has been talked about quite frequently is their [support of anti-climate science organizations][bullet] such as the Heartland institute. As a company that is advocating for climate action, providing this institution with 15% of their funding can contribute significantly to anti-climate science lobbying efforts that contradicts Google’s mission of meeting the standards and going beyond their goals of carbon emission reduction. If Google is not going to use their only lobbyists to take action on climate change, funding the opposite side will make they pact for carbon mitigation efforts less believable. Therefore, I recommend having your financial donations and support align with your political and social justice movements that you’ve [committed to in front of the UN][un].
