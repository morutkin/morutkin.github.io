## What is COP 24? 

COP 24, or the conference of the parties in Katowice, Poland is the 24th time a general body gathered in one place to roll out improvements and updates on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Last year, there were a group of 197 nations and territories  who gathered to participate in this discussion.

 In addition to the general meeting, there were also multiple sessions held by committees happening as well. One of these being the Technology Executive Committee (TEC)  which worked on the technology framework which talks about how we will support developing countries access and develop the technologies needed to help adapt to the impacts that they face and to help transition to a low carbon economy. However, the mission at hand was not as well implemented as the framework had neglected to discuss actionable next steps.

## The Technology Framework

The purpose of working on the technology framework is to prioritize what is next in ensuring that we provide the developing countries with the technology to work towards adaptation and mitigation efforts for more ongoing climate change. In order for this to happen, TEC recognized the importance of their collaboration with the Green Climate Fund to finance the research, development, and deployment of these technologies. 

The technology framework helps to support the technology mechanism made under the Paris agreement which is  “The long-term vision for technology development and transfer shared by Parties relates to the importance of fully realizing technology development and transfer in order to improve resilience to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions” [(IISD Reporting Services)][IISD]

## Accomplishments
The technology framework during the COP 24, accomplished to elaborate on the clarity of the key themes needed to implement to technology mechanism including: 

- innovation
- implementation 
- enabling environment and capacity building
- support
- collaboration and stakeholder engagement

In addition to this, talks about gender-responsive technology and innovative approaches were also mentioned at the conference.
