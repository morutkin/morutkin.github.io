            <h2>What does IoT bring to the table?</h2>
            <p> IoT (Internet of Things) devices are sensors that can share data through the internet. IoT is currently used to collect data for a variety 
              of things changing within the environment including deforestation, and carbon concentation in the atmosphere. Currently, one of the most prevelent uses of
              IoT devices is to track energy consumption. These sensors, provide data analytics that can then be used to make informed decidions to improve energy 
              efficiency within buildings. These devices can and have been helping businesses reach their sustainability goals.

            I'm Momo Rutkin, and I'm here to educate people of the impacts of IoT devices in climate change related issues, specifically on energy related carbon emissions in buildings.  This is also a collection of tasks that I have completed for ENVS 326. 
            I double majored in computer science and environmnetal science because I strongly believe in the potential of technology and big data for climate change action. 
            The more data that we collect through technology, the more accurately we can pinpoint sources of emissions 
            and anaylize the effects of the anthropogenic carbon footprint. Through this blog, I hope to walk you through the 
            impacts IoT devices have been having in our carbon curbing efforts.
