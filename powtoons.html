              I'm Momo Rutkin, and I'm here to educate people of the impacts of IoT devices in climate change related issues, specifically on energy related carbon emissions in buildings.  This is also a collection of tasks that I have completed for ENVS 326. 
              I double majored in computer science and environmnetal science because I strongly believe in the potential of technology and big data for climate change action. 
              The more data that we collect through technology, the more accurately we can pinpoint sources of emissions 
              and anaylize the effects of the anthropogenic carbon footprint. Through this blog, I hope to walk you through the 
              impacts IoT devices have been having in our carbon curbing efforts.
